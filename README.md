Alfido Tech second #internship project

Project Overview:
A #Word #Counter is a utility program designed to analyze text documents. It reads a given text document and provides valuable statistics, including the total number of words, the total number of lines, and the frequency of each word used in the document. This project is implemented in Java and leverages the Java Swing library to create a user-friendly graphical user interface (GUI).

Key Features:

File Input: The project allows the user to input a text document (e.g., a .txt file) for analysis. Users can select the document they want to analyze from their local file system.

Word Count: The Word Counter processes the selected document, splits the text into individual words, and counts the total number of words present. This metric provides users with an understanding of the document's length and complexity.

Line Count: The program also calculates and displays the total number of lines in the document. This can be particularly useful for understanding the document's structure and formatting.

Word Frequency Analysis: In addition to word count and line count, the Word Counter performs a word frequency analysis. It identifies how often each unique word appears in the document and provides users with a list of words along with their respective occurrence frequencies.

Average Word Length: The Word Counter calculates the average length of words in the document. This information can be useful for assessing the document's writing style and complexity.


Technology Stack:

Java: The project is developed using Java for text document processing and GUI development.
Java Swing: Java Swing is used to create a user-friendly graphical user interface.
IntelliJ IDEA IDE: The development environment where the project is created and maintained.
